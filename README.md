# About The Project

Small business owners often get exploited by moneylenders when borrowing money. High and unfair rates of interest, middlemen, and a process where the entire power lies in the hands of the lender leaves the borrowers vulnerable to exploitation. The entire process is very slow, and requires a lot of manual work.

We propose a solution to this problem through our DApp Decentralised Financial Peer to Peer Lender based on blockchain technology built on ethereum.

### Why Blockchain?

* **Time efficient :** Blockchain allows us to make the entire process decentralized, where neither of the parties has all of the power. It offers transparency and connects the borrower directly to the lender; with no middlemen involved. The process is automated and hence a lot faster than traditional lending methods.
* **Fair Interest Rates :** Since blockchain is immutable, the interest rate once decided upon cannot be changed later in an unfair way. The lender gets to specify the desired interest rate beforehand and the borrower gets to choose the interest rate he wants from the ones offered by the different lenders.
* **Seamless repayment :** Blockchain also removes the worry of the lenders of having their loans repaid. If the borrower does not repay the loan before the specified due date, the lenders have the mortgage submitted by the borrower which can then be auctioned off.
